## Blast Jackpot

There is only one function in this contract, `roll()`. If you call it with a certain value (at least 0.005 ETH), one of three things will happen:

1. 49.5% of the time, you will lose your money
2. 49.5% of the time, you will 1.99x your money
3. 1% of the time, you'll win a jackpot of accumulated contract funds

Happy flipping.
